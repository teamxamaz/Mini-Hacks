# AzureMobileApps - Server

This is the STEP 1 of the Azure Mobile App challenge. In this, you will be creating an Azure Mobile app and integrating it with a SQL Server and adding authentication in the backend Node.js server.
　
 
#### You must add Authentication (Service Providers) in your app backend with any *ONE* provider: Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter. 

## Challenge Walkthrough:
You can begin by  creating a Mobile app on Azure. Go to the *Quick Start* section and integrate it with a SQL database. Later you can follow steps for registering your applications with your favourite providers and adding the details of the same to Azure app.

* Create Azure Mobile app
* Register your app with a provider 
   
## Create Azure Mobile App
　
    1. Go to Azure Portal. Under "New", select Mobile App.

    3. Go to the *QuickStart* section and connect the AzureMobileApp to the following
*    SQL Database Server.
*    Node.js backend - You can create this easily by following the second step under the QuickStart section.

At the end of this step, you will see something similar to the below image.

4.Go under the *Easy Tables* tab under your Azure Mobile App > Click on ADD FROM CSV > Upload the myTable.csv which is present  [here](https://github.com/nishanil/Mini-Hacks/blob/master/AzureMobileApps/myTable.csv)


## Register your app with a provider (Any 2)
Note: in this process, you will come across some keys/passwords/client secrets specific to the provider you choose and your app. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.  
　
## Register your application with Facebook
1. Log on to the Azure portal, and navigate to your application. Copy your URL. You will use this to configure your Facebook app.
