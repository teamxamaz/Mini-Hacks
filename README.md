# Mini-Hacks

We invite you to join the Microsoft Team India's Mini-Hacks challenge: a fast, easy, and fun way to explore native mobile development with Xamarin. Each mini-hack consists of a small programming challenge involving a specific set of APIs or a particular third-party programming framework.

Mini-hacks are designed to stimulate developers of all skill levelsâ€”each challenge comes with step-by-step instructions to guide you if you get stuck. You can find all of the challenges in this GitHub repository.

To get started, click one of the mini-hack folders above and attempt to complete the challenge that is described in the included README file.

_Note: Mini-Hacks are inspired by [Xamarin's original challenges for Evolve](https://github.com/xamarin/mini-hacks). The hacks in this repository are used for contests by Microsoft Team in India. You're free to try!_
